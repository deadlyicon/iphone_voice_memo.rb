What:

  iphone_voice_memo.rb
  
  So the iPhone 3.0 uses an sqlite3 database to store data about its Voice Memo Recordings. This lib
  provides an AciveRecord class called IPhoneVoiceMemo and some helper scripts

How to use it:

  - copy the /Recordings directory off your iPhone
    - I used PhoneView (http://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/)
  - make sure the config.rb file knows where it is
  - then run ./add_memo.rb some_sound_file.m4a 'the memo name'
  - copy the new audio file and Recordings/Recordings.db back to the iphone
  
  note: make sure the voice memo app is closed when you copy because when it closes it writes its cache to the db
  note: as far as I can tell it can play m4a and aiff files
  note: using ffmpeg to convert files to m4a is crazy easy (port install ffmpeg, ffmpeg -i infile.mp3 outfile.m4a)
  
Requirements
  - ActiveRecord
